&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Abdulsalam Usman I am 24 years old, I am a young guy with a lot of achievements when I was a child I have always dream of building a business that will earn me a lot of money but not working for any one as an employee, so I have always have it in mind to study about information when I grew up because I know that in studying information I will gain a lot of ideas and also experience to start up my own business, when I got to secondary school I was in art class because I knew I could study a lot about information been an art student so I read a lot of motivational books written by Robert kiyossaki, fortunately for me when I was in ss2 I seat for a scholarship exam that was brought to my school with this opportunity I was able to learn web development for free at oracle world links, this was my first achievement.
However, by the time I get to ss3 I seat for WAEC, after I finish my WAEC while waiting for the result to be release I started searching for opportunities online I visit so many websites to read about business I wrote a lot of proposals to associations maybe if I share my business plan with them may be they might invest on the idea but then I couldn’t get an investor, on this process I met with a medical doctor online who introduced me to network marketing business. The network marketing company he introduced me to was GREENLIFE HERBAL NETWORK, The business is all about creating HEALTH and WEALTH, this company has product that cures ailments, so by sharing the product and also recruiting people into your team will earn once huge amount of money, so when I joined instead of walking all around the street talking to people about product and also the business so I started sharing information about the company business plan and products for ailments online, I create groups where I discuss with masses and also I do create links and share to people to read more about the company through this I started making money online and this was the second great achievement that I had.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two month that have been into the business my WAEC  result was released and fortunately for me I had 4C,3B and 2A’s , that day I was so much happy and I could call this my third achievement, so after this I took jamb to seek for admission after the time result came out but  I couldn’t get admission that same year so I continue with me business, so as at last year which is 2018 I sat for jamb again and I scored 234, I was extremely happy, this was my fourth achievement so after some months I dream of opening my own GREENLIFE OFFICE where it would be a service center for taking care of patient and also recruiting people to business I started working towards the plan.
On the 23rd of August I was able secure admission into KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY and fortunately for me I was given my dream course which was LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. This was my fifth achievement.<br> When I resume to school I was still doing my online business but my plan of setting up my own service center is still on my mind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 17th of May 2019 I registered my own service center at GREENLIFE head office at Lagos, and I opened my own office at Ein-Ile kwara state, with this I took a secretary to be working for me which am given salary at the end of every month and I could say this was my sixth great achievement because I was able to set up a business of my own that I even have people working for me, yet I don’t stop moving I still have more things to achieve, but for those that have achieved I still say ALHAMDULILAH (To God be the glory).<br>
